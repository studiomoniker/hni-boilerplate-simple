# Simple boilerplate for HNI Web Covers

A simple starting point for developing web covers for hetnieuweinstituut.nl

Learn more about what a web cover is and the guidelines to follow: [Web Cover Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11jerHdJNZshRjuYrI7uJ0bNghiRwImqJuansFCTWejs/)

### Download

To download the boilerplate click on `Download ZIP` or clone this git repository.

### Proxy images
You need to include three proxy images with the cover. The filenames of these images need to correspond with those in the `settings.ini` file. (For example when you decide to use a jpg instead of a gif)
- `proxy-agenda.png`: 1120px by 630px image to be shown at [hetnieuweinstituut.nl/agenda](hetnieuweinstituut.nl/agenda)
- `proxy-landscape.gif`: 768px by 520px image to be shown on small screens in landscape mode
- `proxy-portrait.gif`: 520px by 768px image to be shown on small screens in landscape mode

### Image Compression
Photographic images: use jpeg compression 80% or less
Graphical bitmap images: png-8 or gif compression
If your cover is purely vector based, you should try making an SVG version.


### Packaging
The cover should be delivered to the web editor of The New Institute as a zip file. To create the zip file on Mac:
1. select all the files in the cover directory (not the cover directory itself)
2. control + click on them
3. select 'compress x items' in the contextual menu
